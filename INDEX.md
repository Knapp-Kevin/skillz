# Skill Catalog Snapshot

**Snapshot date:** 2026-09-05

This is a passive, hand-maintained catalog snapshot of the governed `skillz` corpus. It is navigation and accounting evidence only. The external host agent performs discovery, comparison, evaluation, or reconciliation.

Canonical inputs are `registry/categories.yaml`, `registry/sources.yaml`, `registry/local-verification.json`, `registry/skills/`, and `registry/verification/`.

## Registered source roles

**Pinned reference corpora:** `anthropic-skills`, `anthropic-knowledge-work-plugins`, `vercel-agent-skills`, `microsoft-skills`, `microsoft-azure-skills`, `aws-agent-toolkit`, `mattpocock-skills`, `addyosmani-agent-skills`, `openhands-extensions`, `cline-skills`, `cloudflare-skills`, `google-agents-cli`.

**Tracked corpora:** `cole-medin-skills`, `david-ondrej-skills`, `bm629-agent-skills`, `openclaw-agent-skills`, `archieindian-superpowers`.

**Normative/discovery:** `agentskills-spec` is a normative specification; `github-awesome-copilot` is a dynamic discovery surface.

## Interpretation

Physical presence or registration does not establish individual skill quality. For unchanged third-party consideration, use exact-version companion evidence and apply:

**user fit → exact-version quality → operational fit → skill freshness → provenance/source context**

AWS is fully reconciled at **72/72**. Microsoft Skills is active at **173/189**, leaving **16** gaps. Direct `.NET`, Java, Python, Rust, and TypeScript slices are complete.

A 2026-09-05 contract repair restored ten genuinely missing Microsoft YAML companion pairs from the auxiliary Markdown review wave beginning with `kql`. `skill-creator` already had a canonical YAML pair, so its re-review refreshed that pair rather than adding another companion. Canonical counts are derived from `registry/`, not auxiliary review prose.

Latest non-direct Microsoft closure: `wiki-onboarding` is **rejected unchanged, 13/20**, bound to package tree `3c95e30a619b223fb2ad107322fcbb9be46f13f5` and `SKILL.md` blob `c708309fd6314cb58788dcacc40216675024b989`; freshness is revision `67ae723a23ba880e3e5c8a3e5e2320092024476e` from 2026-04-02. Preserve audience-specific onboarding decomposition, source-repository resolution, language-aware contributor guidance, evidence-linked diagrams/tables, and validation checks. Unchanged adoption is rejected because it directs persistent creation of five onboarding documents without a mandatory action-specific authorization checkpoint immediately before mutation. Executive/Product requirements also create unsupported-claim risk when ownership, cost, SLA, roadmap, compliance, current-metric, or planned-status evidence is absent. Behavioral validation is `not-run`.

The next Microsoft Skills gap should be established from the exact registered-pin `deep-wiki` skill tree after `wiki-onboarding`, checking canonical companions and repository history before review.

This file has no generator contract. Under explicit repository-maintenance authority, the external host agent reconciles this snapshot directly from live evidence.
