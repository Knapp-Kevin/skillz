# Skill Catalog Snapshot

**Snapshot date:** 2026-09-06

This is a passive, hand-maintained catalog snapshot of the governed `skillz` corpus. It is navigation and accounting evidence only. The external host agent performs discovery, comparison, evaluation, and reconciliation.

Canonical inputs are `registry/categories.yaml`, `registry/sources.yaml`, `registry/local-verification.json`, `registry/skills/`, and `registry/verification/`.

## Registered source roles

**Pinned reference corpora:** `anthropic-skills`, `anthropic-knowledge-work-plugins`, `vercel-agent-skills`, `microsoft-skills`, `microsoft-azure-skills`, `aws-agent-toolkit`, `mattpocock-skills`, `addyosmani-agent-skills`, `openhands-extensions`, `cline-skills`, `cloudflare-skills`, `google-agents-cli`.

**Tracked corpora:** `cole-medin-skills`, `david-ondrej-skills`, `bm629-agent-skills`, `openclaw-agent-skills`, `archieindian-superpowers`.

**Normative/discovery:** `agentskills-spec` is a normative specification; `github-awesome-copilot` is a dynamic discovery surface.

## Interpretation

Physical presence or registration does not establish individual skill quality. For unchanged third-party consideration, use exact-version companion evidence and apply:

**user fit → exact-version quality → operational fit → skill freshness → provenance/source context**

AWS is complete at **72/72**. Microsoft Skills is complete at **186/186**. Microsoft Azure Skills is the active admitted-source frontier at **21/131**, with **110** current-standard gaps.

The latest reconciled Azure unit is `azure-resource-lookup`, rejected unchanged **14/20**, bound to package tree `19e257c3720521014d81cd3dbf4e188e0ece621b` and `SKILL.md` blob `d16d74bd6369fd15f8d96ff0b637ac361c7d6e13`. Exact identity matches the completed Microsoft Skills package, so compatible complete-package review evidence was reconciled rather than repeated. Preserve its dedicated-tool-first routing, Azure Resource Graph fallback, subscription/result scoping, query shaping, and orphan/tag inventory mechanisms. Unchanged adoption remains rejected because its missing-extension recovery installs the `resource-graph` Azure CLI extension without a mandatory action-specific authorization checkpoint immediately before the persistent local toolchain mutation. Behavioral validation has not been run.

This file has no generator contract. Under explicit repository-maintenance authority, the external host agent reconciles this snapshot directly from live evidence.
