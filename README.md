**A passive skill knowledge resource for AI agents.** `skillz` accumulates reusable skills, procedures, safeguards, anti-patterns, rejected examples, creator methods, standards, pinned source material, provenance, exact-version review evidence, tags, source context, catalog snapshots, and instructions so an external host agent can construct the smallest useful skill set for the user.

> **AI agent? Start with [`AGENT_START_HERE.md`](AGENT_START_HERE.md).** For first-visit or returning-user skill-system work, [`engine/skills/skill-bootstrap/SKILL.md`](engine/skills/skill-bootstrap/SKILL.md) is the canonical passive procedure.

> **Normal-use boundary:** skills created, adapted, composed, or refined for a user belong in that user's active AI/agent environment or in a portable handoff. They are not written back here unless repository maintenance/curation was explicitly requested.

## What `skillz` is

`skillz` is entirely passive. The external host agent is the active system. The repository owns no runtime, scripts, tests, CI workflows, schedulers, monitors, crawlers, installers, synchronizers, preflight processes, generators, background services, vector databases, autonomous observers, or personalization services.

The repository provides four surfaces:

1. **43 first-party user-facing skills** under [`skills/`](skills/).
2. **12 intact pinned third-party corpora** under [`skills/sources/`](skills/sources/) at exact upstream revisions.
3. **Governed provenance and exact-version evidence** under [`registry/skills/`](registry/skills/) and [`registry/verification/`](registry/verification/).
4. **Passive repository-use and curation procedures** under [`engine/skills/`](engine/skills/), excluded from user-facing inventory.

Third-party packages may contain their own scripts, tests, examples, fixtures, templates, or tools. Those remain upstream package material, not repository-owned execution machinery.

## Core use

The host agent should identify durable user needs, inspect the minimum relevant evidence, compare available first-party and governed third-party material, then evaluate in this order:

**user fit → exact-version quality → operational fit → skill freshness → provenance/source context**

Valid outcomes include ADOPT, ADAPT, EXTRACT, SUPPLEMENT, COMPOSE, CREATE, CHECKLIST, DYNAMIC behavior, or NO CHANGE. The goal is the smallest coherent fitted system, not maximum reuse.

## Corpus and evidence

[`skills/`](skills/) contains **43 active first-party user-facing skills**, all **43/43 provenance-complete**. The 12 pinned corpora are Anthropic Skills, Anthropic Knowledge Work Plugins, Vercel Agent Skills, Microsoft Skills, Microsoft Azure Skills, AWS Agent Toolkit, Matt Pocock Skills, Addy Osmani Agent Skills, OpenHands Extensions, Cline Skills, Cloudflare Skills, and Google Agents CLI. Exact source identity, role, terms, and pins live in [`registry/sources.yaml`](registry/sources.yaml). The registry contains **19 unique source identities**.

There are currently **362 persisted exact-version third-party verification companions**. `verified` means structured static semantic review of an exact version. `validated` additionally requires representative external behavioral/adversarial evidence. `rejected` and `retired` remain useful bounded prior art but are excluded from normal unchanged selection.

## Discovery and admission

**discovery surface → candidate issue/source → source-vetting → exact-version static evaluation → decisive admission result → repository persistence when justified → user-fit decision**

New third-party discoveries use [`docs/candidate-intake.md`](docs/candidate-intake.md). Discovery scores, popularity, official branding, creator reputation, or catalog recommendations are signals only. Restricted or unclear-license material remains reference-only unless terms justify another role.

## Current curation state

Core passive architecture is complete. Ongoing work is corpus enrichment and evidence reconciliation.

- **AWS Agent Toolkit:** **72/72** current-standard companion complete.
- **Microsoft Skills:** exact denominator **186**; **186/186** current-standard companion complete, **0** gaps.
- **Microsoft Azure Skills:** exact registered-pin denominator **131** at pin `8f8c72bb9e22aee4366e07aadfd5766ef9add8f4`; **4/131** current-standard companion complete, **127** gaps remain.
- Microsoft direct `.NET`: **29/29**; Java: **26/26**; Python: **40/40**; Rust: **9/9**; TypeScript: **25/25**.

The four reconciled Azure packages are `airunway-aks-setup` (verified **17/20**), `appinsights-instrumentation` (rejected unchanged **13/20**), `azure-ai` (rejected unchanged **13/20**), and `azure-aigateway` (rejected unchanged **13/20**). `azure-aigateway` is bound to exact package tree `fb881f68bdc6d638438b46b04ab6d81f91e985ba` and `SKILL.md` blob `a8df9f45fae25501acf7fee988047f808d191fa5`; its normal procedures mutate APIM identity, RBAC, backends, APIs, and gateway policy without a distinct action-specific authorization checkpoint. Behavioral validation remains `not-run`.

Microsoft Skills is current-standard complete at **186/186**. **Microsoft Azure Skills** is the active admitted-source frontier at **4/131**. Historically completed external corpora should be reconciled from compatible prior evidence before fresh re-review.
