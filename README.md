**A passive skill knowledge resource for AI agents.** `skillz` accumulates reusable skills, procedures, safeguards, anti-patterns, rejected examples, creator methods, standards, pinned source material, provenance, exact-version review evidence, tags, source context, catalog snapshots, and instructions so an external host agent can construct the smallest useful skill set for the user.

> **AI agent? Start with [`AGENT_START_HERE.md`](AGENT_START_HERE.md).** For first-visit or returning-user skill-system work, [`engine/skills/skill-bootstrap/SKILL.md`](engine/skills/skill-bootstrap/SKILL.md) is the canonical passive procedure.

> **Normal-use boundary:** skills created, adapted, composed, or refined for a user belong in that user's active AI/agent environment or in a portable handoff. They are not written back here unless repository maintenance/curation was explicitly requested.

## What `skillz` is

`skillz` is entirely passive. The external host agent is the active system. The repository owns no runtime, scripts, tests, CI workflows, schedulers, monitors, crawlers, installers, synchronizers, preflight processes, generators, background services, vector databases, autonomous observers, or personalization services.

The repository provides four surfaces:

1. **43 first-party user-facing skills** under [`skills/`](skills/).
2. **12 intact pinned third-party corpora** under [`skills/sources/`](skills/sources/) at exact upstream revisions.
3. **Governed provenance and exact-version evidence** under [`registry/skills/`](registry/skills/) and [`registry/verification/`](registry/verification/).
4. **Passive repository-use and curation procedures** under [`engine/skills/`](engine/skills/), excluded from user-facing inventory.

Third-party packages may contain their own scripts, tests, examples, fixtures, templates, or tools. Those remain upstream package material, not repository-owned execution machinery.

## Core use

The host agent should identify durable user needs, inspect the minimum relevant evidence, compare available first-party and governed third-party material, then evaluate in this order:

**user fit → exact-version quality → operational fit → skill freshness → provenance/source context**

Valid outcomes include ADOPT, ADAPT, EXTRACT, SUPPLEMENT, COMPOSE, CREATE, CHECKLIST, DYNAMIC behavior, or NO CHANGE. The goal is the smallest coherent fitted system, not maximum reuse.

## Corpus and evidence

[`skills/`](skills/) contains **43 active first-party user-facing skills**, all **43/43 provenance-complete**. The 12 pinned corpora are Anthropic Skills, Anthropic Knowledge Work Plugins, Vercel Agent Skills, Microsoft Skills, Microsoft Azure Skills, AWS Agent Toolkit, Matt Pocock Skills, Addy Osmani Agent Skills, OpenHands Extensions, Cline Skills, Cloudflare Skills, and Google Agents CLI. Exact source identity, role, terms, and pins live in [`registry/sources.yaml`](registry/sources.yaml). The registry contains **19 unique source identities**.

There are currently **407 persisted exact-version third-party verification companions**. `verified` means structured static semantic review of an exact version. `validated` additionally requires representative external behavioral/adversarial evidence. `rejected` and `retired` remain useful bounded prior art but are excluded from normal unchanged selection.

## Discovery and admission

**discovery surface → candidate issue/source → source-vetting → exact-version static evaluation → decisive admission result → repository persistence when justified → user-fit decision**

New third-party discoveries use [`docs/candidate-intake.md`](docs/candidate-intake.md). Discovery scores, popularity, official branding, creator reputation, or catalog recommendations are signals only. Restricted or unclear-license material remains reference-only unless terms justify another role.

## Current curation state

Core passive architecture is complete. Ongoing work is corpus enrichment and evidence reconciliation.

- **AWS Agent Toolkit:** **72/72** current-standard companion complete.
- **Microsoft Skills:** exact denominator **186**; **186/186** current-standard companion complete, **0** gaps.
- **Microsoft Azure Skills:** exact registered-pin denominator **34**; **34/34** current-standard companion complete, **0** gaps.
- **Cole Medin Skills:** exact registered-pin denominator **33**; **18/33** current-standard companion complete, **15** gaps.
- Microsoft direct `.NET`: **29/29**; Java: **26/26**; Python: **40/40**; Rust: **9/9**; TypeScript: **25/25**.

The Azure denominator is the exact set of independently eligible `SKILL.md` packages at the registered pin: 28 canonical plugin skill roots, one nested `azure-kubernetes-automatic-readiness` package, and five nested Microsoft Foundry packages beyond the Foundry root. Ordinary workflow, procedure, reference, example, and SDK Markdown does not become a separate skill merely because it is useful or lives in an attractively named directory.

Thirty-four Azure packages have current-standard companion pairs. The latest reconciled Azure package is `python-appservice-deploy`, rejected unchanged **12/20**. Behavioral validation remains `not-run` for all thirty-four reviewed Azure packages.

Cole Medin is now the active admitted-source frontier. Its exact pin exposes **33** first-class `.claude/skills/*/SKILL.md` entries. Eighteen currently have companion pairs. The latest is `piv-run-full-loop`, rejected unchanged **13/20**. Preserve its compact prime → plan → implement → commit phase ordering, explicit inter-stage artifact handoff, and final evidence summary as adaptation/extraction evidence. Unchanged use fails the authority hard rule because its advertised hands-off loop chains plan-file creation, source/test/documentation mutation, validation-command execution, staging, and commit without mandatory action-specific authorization immediately before consequential mutation. It also inherits hostile-instruction risk from repository/plan inputs and sensitive or unrelated-file risk from the all-changes commit step. Behavioral validation is `not-run`.

AWS Agent Toolkit, Microsoft Skills, and Microsoft Azure Skills are current-standard complete at their exact registered pins. Historically completed external corpora should be reconciled from compatible prior evidence before fresh re-review.
