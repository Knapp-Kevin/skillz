## Current architecture

The canonical boundary is stable: user-facing material lives under `skills/`; intact pinned upstream corpora live under `skills/sources/<source-id>/`; passive repository-use/curation procedures live under `engine/skills/` and are excluded from user-facing counts; provenance and exact-version evidence live under `registry/`.

`skillz` owns no runtime, scripts layer, tests gate, CI workflow, scheduler, monitor, crawler, installer, synchronizer, preflight process, generator, background service, vector database, autonomous observer, or personalization service. Tooling inside pinned third-party repositories remains upstream package material.

## Inventory boundaries

- First-party: **43/43 provenance-complete** with structured semantic review evidence.
- AWS Agent Toolkit: exact denominator **72**, **72/72 current-standard companion-complete** at pin `ff1481a7bc1a04ee00ebf63d3a8a149aa6a2c546`.
- Microsoft Skills: exact denominator **189**, **109/189 companion-complete**, **80 gaps** at pin `32cad4ee689c95c309e61aeefcbc6af356f1e6a7`.
- Microsoft direct `.NET`: **29/29** complete.
- Microsoft direct Java: **26/26** complete.
- Microsoft direct Python: **40/40** complete.
- Microsoft direct Rust: **9/9** complete.
- Microsoft direct TypeScript: **2/25** complete.

Completion means decisive current evidence for every eligible package, not universal approval. Rejected/retired material remains useful bounded prior art.

## Active Microsoft frontier

The registered-pin TypeScript tree contains exactly **25** first-class packages. Its upstream plugin README says 24 because it omits `applicationinsights-web-ts`, which nevertheless exists as a separate first-class package at the same pin. Tree truth controls the denominator.

`applicationinsights-web-ts` was already current-standard companion-complete. The next genuine source-ordered gap, `azure-ai-contentsafety-ts`, is now **rejected unchanged, 11/20**, with `validation_status: not-run`. Its text/image harm-classification, blocklist, REST error-handling, and credential patterns remain useful prior art, but unchanged use sends potentially sensitive moderation content to Azure without a mandatory disclosure/privacy authority gate, permits remote image retrieval without an explicit trusted-source boundary, mutates or deletes service-side blocklists without action-specific authorization, and recommends moderation logging without minimization/redaction/retention constraints.

Microsoft Skills remains active with **80** gaps. Continue TypeScript source-order from `azure-ai-document-intelligence-ts`, while preserving the complete `.NET`, Java, Python, and Rust slices.

## Source lifecycle

**discovery surface → candidate issue/source → source-vetting → exact-version static evaluation → decisive admission result → repository persistence when justified → user-fit decision**

Discovery is intelligence only. Popularity, branding, creator reputation, and source-level signals never prove individual skill quality.

## Quality model

Every governed user-facing skill must retain truthful provenance and applicable exact-version evidence before being called companion-complete. `verified` means exact material passed structured static semantic review. `validated` additionally requires representative external behavioral/adversarial evidence. `stale`, `rejected`, and `retired` are excluded from normal unchanged reuse while remaining useful evidence where appropriate.

Interpret candidate material in this order:

**user fit → exact-version quality → operational fit → skill freshness → provenance/source context**

## Current curation priority

1. Continue Microsoft Skills in coherent source-ordered batches; direct `.NET`, Java, Python, and Rust are complete, TypeScript is active at 2/25.
2. Complete Microsoft Azure Skills.
3. Reconcile historically completed external corpora from compatible prior evidence before fresh re-review.
4. Continue governed discovery/source-vetting and omission recovery.
5. Keep README, this file, `CURATION_QUEUE.md`, `INDEX.md`, and `index.json` aligned with live evidence.

The living work surface is `CURATION_QUEUE.md` plus applicable open evaluation/provenance issues. Historical closed Wayfinder/issues/PRs remain evidence, not active execution plans.
