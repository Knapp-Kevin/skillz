## Current architecture

The canonical boundary is stable: user-facing material lives under `skills/`; intact pinned upstream corpora live under `skills/sources/<source-id>/`; passive repository-use/curation procedures live under `engine/skills/` and are excluded from user-facing counts; provenance and exact-version evidence live under `registry/`.

`skillz` owns no runtime, scripts layer, tests gate, CI workflow, scheduler, monitor, crawler, installer, synchronizer, preflight process, generator, background service, vector database, autonomous observer, or personalization service. Tooling inside pinned third-party repositories remains upstream package material.

## Inventory boundaries

- First-party: **43/43 provenance-complete** with structured semantic review evidence.
- AWS Agent Toolkit: **72/72** current-standard companion-complete.
- Microsoft Skills: **186/186** companion-complete, **0 gaps**.
- Microsoft Azure Skills: exact registered-pin denominator **131**, **8/131** companion-complete, **123 gaps** at pin `8f8c72bb9e22aee4366e07aadfd5766ef9add8f4`.
- Microsoft direct `.NET`: **29/29**; Java: **26/26**; Python: **40/40**; Rust: **9/9**; TypeScript: **25/25**.

Completion means decisive current evidence for every eligible package, not universal approval. Rejected/retired material remains useful bounded prior art.

## Microsoft Azure Skills frontier

`airunway-aks-setup` and `azure-cloud-migrate` are verified **17/20**. `appinsights-instrumentation`, `azure-ai`, and `azure-aigateway` are rejected unchanged **13/20**. `azure-compliance` is rejected unchanged **12/20**. `azure-compute` is rejected unchanged **11/20**. `azure-cost` is rejected unchanged **14/20**. Behavioral validation remains `not-run` for all eight reviewed Azure packages.

`azure-cost` is bound to exact tree `b9f59c28575280e1f76aaf2b94d92b040b571c52`, `SKILL.md` blob `8755e1c4db79a8e1bc44d6d1cdd1d3c55e5976e4`, and Azure-source freshness revision `02a614f6ee1f052826f834d65c61e430ad152c8e` on 2026-06-04. Exact package identity matches compatible prior Microsoft Skills evidence, so the review was reconciled rather than repeated. Preserve cost query, forecast, pricing validation, explicit scope selection, throttling handling, total-bill context, reporting, and optimization-analysis mechanics. Unchanged adoption fails the authority hard rule because bundled optimization paths can enable AKS cost analysis and provide commands/recommendations for deleting or snapshot-and-deleting resources, changing lifecycle deletion/tiering, redundancy/SKUs, retention, and other persistent cost-affecting settings without a mandatory action-specific authorization checkpoint immediately before each consequential mutation.

## Source lifecycle

**discovery surface → candidate issue/source → source-vetting → exact-version static evaluation → decisive admission result → repository persistence when justified → user-fit decision**

Discovery is intelligence only. Popularity, branding, creator reputation, and source-level signals never prove individual skill quality.

## Quality model

Every governed user-facing skill must retain truthful provenance and applicable exact-version evidence before being called companion-complete. `verified` means exact material passed structured static semantic review. `validated` additionally requires representative external behavioral/adversarial evidence. `stale`, `rejected`, and `retired` are excluded from normal unchanged reuse while remaining useful evidence where appropriate.

Interpret candidate material in this order:

**user fit → exact-version quality → operational fit → skill freshness → provenance/source context**

## Current curation priority

1. Continue Microsoft Azure Skills from **8/131**, checking canonical companion paths and repository history before each unit.
2. Reconcile historically completed external corpora from compatible prior evidence before fresh re-review.
3. Continue governed discovery/source-vetting and omission recovery.
4. Resolve bounded candidate issues when evidence supports a decisive outcome.
5. Keep README, this file, `CURATION_QUEUE.md`, `INDEX.md`, and `index.json` aligned with live evidence.

The living work surface is `CURATION_QUEUE.md` plus applicable open evaluation/provenance issues. Historical closed Wayfinder/issues/PRs remain evidence, not active execution plans.
