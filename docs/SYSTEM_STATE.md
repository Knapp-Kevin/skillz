## Current architecture

The canonical boundary is stable: user-facing material lives under `skills/`; intact pinned upstream corpora live under `skills/sources/<source-id>/`; passive repository-use/curation procedures live under `engine/skills/` and are excluded from user-facing counts; provenance and exact-version evidence live under `registry/`.

`skillz` owns no runtime, scripts layer, tests gate, CI workflow, scheduler, monitor, crawler, installer, synchronizer, preflight process, generator, background service, vector database, autonomous observer, or personalization service. Tooling inside pinned third-party repositories remains upstream package material.

## Inventory boundaries

- First-party: **43/43 provenance-complete** with structured semantic review evidence.
- AWS Agent Toolkit: **72/72** current-standard companion-complete.
- Microsoft Skills: **186/186** companion-complete, **0 gaps**.
- Microsoft Azure Skills: exact registered-pin denominator **131**, **11/131** companion-complete, **120 gaps** at pin `8f8c72bb9e22aee4366e07aadfd5766ef9add8f4`.
- Microsoft direct `.NET`: **29/29**; Java: **26/26**; Python: **40/40**; Rust: **9/9**; TypeScript: **25/25**.

Completion means decisive current evidence for every eligible package, not universal approval. Rejected/retired material remains useful bounded prior art.

## Microsoft Azure Skills frontier

`airunway-aks-setup` and `azure-cloud-migrate` are verified **17/20**. `azure-enterprise-infra-planner` is verified **18/20**. `appinsights-instrumentation`, `azure-ai`, and `azure-aigateway` are rejected unchanged **13/20**. `azure-compliance` is rejected unchanged **12/20**. `azure-compute` is rejected unchanged **11/20**. `azure-cost` is rejected unchanged **14/20**. `azure-deploy` is rejected unchanged **15/20**. `azure-diagnostics` is rejected unchanged **13/20**. Behavioral validation remains `not-run` for all eleven reviewed Azure packages.

`azure-enterprise-infra-planner` is bound to exact tree `620e71b64d369c1ea3aa5c8f4feee7793841e7a5`, `SKILL.md` blob `a261c21ed056be1958902cf23f6ae4879001b404`, and Azure-source freshness revision `02a614f6ee1f052826f834d65c61e430ad152c8e` on 2026-06-04. Exact package identity matches compatible prior Microsoft Skills evidence, so the complete-package review was reconciled rather than repeated. Preserve its evidence-first seven-phase workflow, WAF/resource/constraint checks, explicit preliminary resource-selection approval, separate manual plan approval before IaC generation, and fresh deployment authorization after risks are presented. The deployment gate explicitly rejects the original prompt and vague assent as authorization, confirms subscription/resource group, and requires explicit destructive-action confirmation. This satisfies the current authority hard rule for the consequential provisioning path. No literal-secret solicitation into conversational context was identified. Behavioral validation remains `not-run`.

## Source lifecycle

**discovery surface → candidate issue/source → source-vetting → exact-version static evaluation → decisive admission result → repository persistence when justified → user-fit decision**

Discovery is intelligence only. Popularity, branding, creator reputation, and source-level signals never prove individual skill quality.

## Quality model

Every governed user-facing skill must retain truthful provenance and applicable exact-version evidence before being called companion-complete. `verified` means exact material passed structured static semantic review. `validated` additionally requires representative external behavioral/adversarial evidence. `stale`, `rejected`, and `retired` are excluded from normal unchanged reuse while remaining useful evidence where appropriate.

Interpret candidate material in this order:

**user fit → exact-version quality → operational fit → skill freshness → provenance/source context**

## Current curation priority

1. Continue Microsoft Azure Skills from **11/131**, checking canonical companion paths and repository history before each unit.
2. Reconcile historically completed external corpora from compatible prior evidence before fresh re-review.
3. Continue governed discovery/source-vetting and omission recovery.
4. Resolve bounded candidate issues when evidence supports a decisive outcome.
5. Keep README, this file, `CURATION_QUEUE.md`, `INDEX.md`, and `index.json` aligned with live evidence.

The living work surface is `CURATION_QUEUE.md` plus applicable open evaluation/provenance issues. Historical closed Wayfinder/issues/PRs remain evidence, not active execution plans.
