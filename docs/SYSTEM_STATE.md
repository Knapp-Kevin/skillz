## Current architecture

The canonical boundary is stable: user-facing material lives under `skills/`; intact pinned upstream corpora live under `skills/sources/<source-id>/`; passive repository-use/curation procedures live under `engine/skills/` and are excluded from user-facing counts; provenance and exact-version evidence live under `registry/`.

`skillz` owns no runtime, scripts layer, tests gate, CI workflow, scheduler, monitor, crawler, installer, synchronizer, preflight process, generator, background service, vector database, autonomous observer, or personalization service. Tooling inside pinned third-party repositories remains upstream package material.

## Inventory boundaries

- First-party: **43/43 provenance-complete** with structured semantic review evidence.
- AWS Agent Toolkit: exact denominator **72**, **72/72 current-standard companion-complete** at pin `ff1481a7bc1a04ee00ebf63d3a8a149aa6a2c546`.
- Microsoft Skills: exact denominator **189**, **167/189 companion-complete**, **22 gaps** at pin `32cad4ee689c95c309e61aeefcbc6af356f1e6a7`.
- Microsoft direct `.NET`: **29/29** complete.
- Microsoft direct Java: **26/26** complete.
- Microsoft direct Python: **40/40** complete.
- Microsoft direct Rust: **9/9** complete.
- Microsoft direct TypeScript: **25/25** complete.

Completion means decisive current evidence for every eligible package, not universal approval. Rejected/retired material remains useful bounded prior art.

## Active Microsoft frontier

The direct TypeScript slice is **25/25 current-standard companion-complete**. The non-direct Microsoft plugin/front-door frontier is active. Latest closure: nested `microsoft-foundry/finetuning` is **rejected unchanged, 12/20**, bound to package tree `f4fce572b9e1db4e7880315bf39045d03f42a0fd` and `SKILL.md` blob `68ad2dc82e4e38b5bdc07170ae1a2aa477b0a277`, with freshness revision `981d9b71d0187be796b03c2f4d69cccca80c0e42` from 2026-05-25. Preserve its baseline-first discipline, SFT/DPO/RFT selection, dataset validation, grader calibration, reward-hacking checks, checkpoint evaluation, cost/accuracy comparison, and training-curve diagnostics. Unchanged adoption is rejected because it permits consequential uploads, paid training, deployments, model/evaluation calls, synthetic-data generation, and cleanup without mandatory action-specific authorization and lacks a universal disclosure/minimization boundary for data-bearing workflows. Behavioral validation is `not-run`.

Microsoft Skills remains active with **22** gaps. Establish the next gap from the registered-pin tree after the independently front-mattered `finetuning` entry.

## Source lifecycle

**discovery surface → candidate issue/source → source-vetting → exact-version static evaluation → decisive admission result → repository persistence when justified → user-fit decision**

Discovery is intelligence only. Popularity, branding, creator reputation, and source-level signals never prove individual skill quality.

## Quality model

Every governed user-facing skill must retain truthful provenance and applicable exact-version evidence before being called companion-complete. `verified` means exact material passed structured static semantic review. `validated` additionally requires representative external behavioral/adversarial evidence. `stale`, `rejected`, and `retired` are excluded from normal unchanged reuse while remaining useful evidence where appropriate.

Interpret candidate material in this order:

**user fit → exact-version quality → operational fit → skill freshness → provenance/source context**

## Current curation priority

1. Continue Microsoft Skills in registered-pin source order from the first genuine gap after `microsoft-foundry/finetuning`.
2. Complete remaining Microsoft Skills non-direct families.
3. Complete Microsoft Azure Skills.
4. Reconcile historically completed external corpora from compatible prior evidence before fresh re-review.
5. Continue governed discovery/source-vetting and omission recovery.
6. Keep README, this file, `CURATION_QUEUE.md`, `INDEX.md`, and `index.json` aligned with live evidence.

The living work surface is `CURATION_QUEUE.md` plus applicable open evaluation/provenance issues. Historical closed Wayfinder/issues/PRs remain evidence, not active execution plans.
