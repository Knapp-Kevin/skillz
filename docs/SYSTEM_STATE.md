## Current architecture

The canonical boundary is stable: user-facing material lives under `skills/`; intact pinned upstream corpora live under `skills/sources/<source-id>/`; passive repository-use/curation procedures live under `engine/skills/` and are excluded from user-facing counts; provenance and exact-version evidence live under `registry/`.

`skillz` owns no runtime, scripts layer, tests gate, CI workflow, scheduler, monitor, crawler, installer, synchronizer, preflight process, generator, background service, vector database, autonomous observer, or personalization service. Tooling inside pinned third-party repositories remains upstream package material.

## Inventory boundaries

- First-party: **43/43 provenance-complete** with structured semantic review evidence.
- AWS Agent Toolkit: exact denominator **72**, **72/72 current-standard companion-complete** at pin `ff1481a7bc1a04ee00ebf63d3a8a149aa6a2c546`.
- Microsoft Skills: exact denominator **189**, **140/189 companion-complete**, **49 gaps** at pin `32cad4ee689c95c309e61aeefcbc6af356f1e6a7`.
- Microsoft direct `.NET`: **29/29** complete.
- Microsoft direct Java: **26/26** complete.
- Microsoft direct Python: **40/40** complete.
- Microsoft direct Rust: **9/9** complete.
- Microsoft direct TypeScript: **25/25** complete.

Completion means decisive current evidence for every eligible package, not universal approval. Rejected/retired material remains useful bounded prior art.

## Active Microsoft frontier

The direct TypeScript slice is **25/25 current-standard companion-complete**. Twenty-two packages are rejected unchanged and three bounded local implementation packages are verified: `frontend-ui-dark-ts` **15/20**, `react-flow-node-ts` **15/20**, and `zustand-store-ts` **16/20**. Exact identities, freshness, authority, portability, dependencies, rationale, and validation state remain in their individual companion records.

The non-direct Microsoft plugin frontier is active. Reviewed packages now include:

1. `airunway-aks-setup` — **rejected unchanged, 15/20**.
2. `appinsights-instrumentation` — **rejected unchanged, 12/20**.
3. `azure-ai` — **rejected unchanged, 10/20**.
4. `azure-aigateway` — **rejected unchanged, 8/20**.
5. `azure-cloud-migrate` — **rejected unchanged, 9/20**.
6. `azure-compliance` — **rejected unchanged, 12/20**.
7. `azure-compute` — **rejected unchanged, 11/20**.
8. `azure-cost` — **rejected unchanged, 14/20**, package tree `b9f59c28575280e1f76aaf2b94d92b040b571c52`, `SKILL.md` blob `8755e1c4db79a8e1bc44d6d1cdd1d3c55e5976e4`, freshness revision `ba3700d41a07ab5e01919ce9a42a38907186a9fe` from 2026-06-04. It preserves strong read-oriented cost query/forecast, scope selection, throttling discipline, pricing validation, total-bill context, and optimization heuristics. Unchanged adoption fails because bundled optimization guidance can enable the AKS cost-analysis add-on and includes implementation guidance for destructive or persistent cost/resource changes without mandatory action-specific authorization immediately before mutation. Behavioral validation is `not-run`.

Microsoft Skills remains active with **49** gaps. Establish the next gap from the registered-pin tree after `azure-cost`; do not infer it from stale prompts or historical issue text.

## Source lifecycle

**discovery surface → candidate issue/source → source-vetting → exact-version static evaluation → decisive admission result → repository persistence when justified → user-fit decision**

Discovery is intelligence only. Popularity, branding, creator reputation, and source-level signals never prove individual skill quality.

## Quality model

Every governed user-facing skill must retain truthful provenance and applicable exact-version evidence before being called companion-complete. `verified` means exact material passed structured static semantic review. `validated` additionally requires representative external behavioral/adversarial evidence. `stale`, `rejected`, and `retired` are excluded from normal unchanged reuse while remaining useful evidence where appropriate.

Interpret candidate material in this order:

**user fit → exact-version quality → operational fit → skill freshness → provenance/source context**

## Current curation priority

1. Continue Microsoft Skills in registered-pin source order from the first genuine gap after `azure-cost`.
2. Complete remaining Microsoft Skills non-direct plugin families.
3. Complete Microsoft Azure Skills.
4. Reconcile historically completed external corpora from compatible prior evidence before fresh re-review.
5. Continue governed discovery/source-vetting and omission recovery.
6. Keep README, this file, `CURATION_QUEUE.md`, `INDEX.md`, and `index.json` aligned with live evidence.

The living work surface is `CURATION_QUEUE.md` plus applicable open evaluation/provenance issues. Historical closed Wayfinder/issues/PRs remain evidence, not active execution plans.
