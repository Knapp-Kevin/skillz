## Current architecture

The canonical boundary is stable: user-facing material lives under `skills/`; intact pinned upstream corpora live under `skills/sources/<source-id>/`; passive repository-use/curation procedures live under `engine/skills/` and are excluded from user-facing counts; provenance and exact-version evidence live under `registry/`.

`skillz` owns no runtime, scripts layer, tests gate, CI workflow, scheduler, monitor, crawler, installer, synchronizer, preflight process, generator, background service, vector database, autonomous observer, or personalization service. Tooling inside pinned third-party repositories remains upstream package material.

## Inventory boundaries

- First-party: **43/43 provenance-complete** with structured semantic review evidence.
- AWS Agent Toolkit: **72/72** current-standard companion-complete.
- Microsoft Skills: **186/186** companion-complete, **0 gaps**.
- Microsoft Azure Skills: exact registered-pin denominator **131**, **15/131** companion-complete, **116 gaps** at pin `8f8c72bb9e22aee4366e07aadfd5766ef9add8f4`.
- Microsoft direct `.NET`: **29/29**; Java: **26/26**; Python: **40/40**; Rust: **9/9**; TypeScript: **25/25**.

Completion means decisive current evidence for every eligible package, not universal approval. Rejected/retired material remains useful bounded prior art.

## Microsoft Azure Skills frontier

`airunway-aks-setup` and `azure-cloud-migrate` are verified **17/20**. `azure-enterprise-infra-planner` is verified **18/20**. `appinsights-instrumentation`, `azure-ai`, `azure-aigateway`, `azure-diagnostics`, and `azure-hosted-copilot-sdk` are rejected unchanged **13/20**. `azure-compliance` and `azure-kubernetes` are rejected unchanged **12/20**. `azure-compute` is rejected unchanged **11/20**. `azure-cost` and `azure-kusto` are rejected unchanged **14/20**. `azure-deploy` and `azure-kubernetes-automatic-readiness` are rejected unchanged **15/20**. Behavioral validation remains `not-run` for all fifteen reviewed Azure packages.

`azure-kusto` is bound to exact tree `71a8cb8f91c6078d4b745c0bf0c46d45437c263f`, `SKILL.md` blob `76e6b1764da1d7352dd3d6056571751f4395c746`, and Azure-source freshness revision `317a8e7b879c0ed6a1890378eafd939bdd9bc749` on 2026-04-22. Exact package identity matches the completed Microsoft Skills package, so compatible complete-package evidence was reconciled rather than repeated. Preserve its schema-first KQL discovery, time filtering, bounded results, aggregation guidance, and query-oriented CLI/REST fallback. Unchanged adoption fails sensitive-data and authority governance because the skill explicitly targets security/audit/user-behavior/telemetry/raw-row data without a mandatory disclosure-scope, minimization, redaction, or sensitive-data authorization checkpoint before results are returned; persistent function/materialized-view/retention/ingestion/monitoring suggestions also require separate action-specific authorization. Behavioral validation remains `not-run`.

## Source lifecycle

**discovery surface → candidate issue/source → source-vetting → exact-version static evaluation → decisive admission result → repository persistence when justified → user-fit decision**

Discovery is intelligence only. Popularity, branding, creator reputation, and source-level signals never prove individual skill quality.

## Quality model

Every governed user-facing skill must retain truthful provenance and applicable exact-version evidence before being called companion-complete. `verified` means exact material passed structured static semantic review. `validated` additionally requires representative external behavioral/adversarial evidence. `stale`, `rejected`, and `retired` are excluded from normal unchanged reuse while remaining useful evidence where appropriate.

Interpret candidate material in this order:

**user fit → exact-version quality → operational fit → skill freshness → provenance/source context**

## Current curation priority

1. Continue Microsoft Azure Skills from **15/131**, checking canonical companion paths and repository history before each unit.
2. Reconcile historically completed external corpora from compatible prior evidence before fresh re-review.
3. Continue governed discovery/source-vetting and omission recovery.
4. Resolve bounded candidate issues when evidence supports a decisive outcome.
5. Keep README, this file, `CURATION_QUEUE.md`, `INDEX.md`, and `index.json` aligned with live evidence.

The living work surface is `CURATION_QUEUE.md` plus applicable open evaluation/provenance issues. Historical closed Wayfinder/issues/PRs remain evidence, not active execution plans.
