## Current architecture

The canonical boundary is stable: user-facing material lives under `skills/`; intact pinned upstream corpora live under `skills/sources/<source-id>/`; passive repository-use/curation procedures live under `engine/skills/` and are excluded from user-facing counts; provenance and exact-version evidence live under `registry/`.

`skillz` owns no runtime, scripts layer, tests gate, CI workflow, scheduler, monitor, crawler, installer, synchronizer, preflight process, generator, background service, vector database, autonomous observer, or personalization service. Tooling inside pinned third-party repositories remains upstream package material.

## Inventory boundaries

- First-party: **44/44 provenance-complete**.
- Anthropic Skills: **17/17**, gaps **0**, **10 verified / 7 rejected unchanged**.
- Anthropic Knowledge Work Plugins: **74/74**, gaps **0**, historical states **36 verified / 38 rejected unchanged**.
- AWS Agent Toolkit: **72/72**, gaps **0**.
- Microsoft Skills: **186/186**, gaps **0**.
- Microsoft Azure Skills: **34/34**, gaps **0**.
- Cole Medin Skills: **33/33**, gaps **0**.
- David Ondrej Skills: exact registered-pin denominator **55**, **17/55** provenance/verification companion complete, gaps **38**; current decisive states **9 verified / 8 rejected unchanged**. Skill authoring is **4/4** complete; agent orchestration is **13/17** reviewed.
- Matt Pocock Skills: **29/29**, gaps **0** after source-policy exclusions.
- Cloudflare Skills: **13/13**, gaps **0**, **11 verified / 2 rejected unchanged**.
- Addy Osmani Agent Skills: **24/24**, gaps **0**.
- Vercel Agent Skills: **9/9**, gaps **0**, **6 verified / 3 rejected unchanged**.
- OpenHands Extensions: **1/1**, gaps **0**; `theme-factory` remains **rejected unchanged 14/20**.
- Google Agents CLI: **7/7**, gaps **0**, all seven verified.
- Cline Skills: **36/36 published**, gaps **0**; internal/unlisted `review-team` remains outside the denominator.
- Microsoft direct `.NET`: **29/29**; Java: **26/26**; Python: **40/40**; Rust: **9/9**; TypeScript: **25/25**.

Completion means decisive current evidence for every eligible package, not universal approval. Rejected/retired material remains useful bounded prior art.

## David Ondrej denominator reconciliation

The registered public snapshot is `7d0ef87dad1f638cab58995eead9e0e6e3fae237`. Direct inspection establishes five category folders with **17 + 11 + 10 + 4 + 13 = 55** first-class skill packages. Current repository evidence contains seventeen exact-version companion pairs. Skill authoring is **4/4** current-standard complete. Agent orchestration is **13/17** reviewed. `herdr` is rejected unchanged 11/20 because its launch procedure mandates auto-approval/permission-bypass modes for downstream agents and substitutes a global deny-list hook for action-specific authorization. Its workspace targeting, status verification, and failure-mode evidence remain useful for adaptation. Behavioral validation remains `not-run`. Together the family is **17/55**, with **38** gaps and **9 verified / 8 rejected unchanged**.

## Source lifecycle

**discovery surface → candidate issue/source → source-vetting → exact-version static evaluation → decisive admission result → repository persistence when justified → user-fit decision**

Discovery is intelligence only. Popularity, branding, creator reputation, and source-level signals never prove individual skill quality.

## Quality model

Every governed user-facing skill must retain truthful provenance and applicable exact-version evidence before being called companion-complete. `verified` means exact material passed structured static semantic review. `validated` additionally requires representative external behavioral/adversarial evidence. `stale`, `rejected`, and `retired` are excluded from normal unchanged reuse while remaining useful evidence where appropriate.

Interpret candidate material in this order:

**user fit → exact-version quality → operational fit → skill freshness → provenance/source context**

## Current curation priority

1. Continue corpus-wide provenance audit #66. David Ondrej Skills is now **17/55**, with **38** exact-version companion gaps; skill authoring is complete and agent orchestration is **13/17** reviewed.
2. Continue recomputing remaining admitted and tracked families for genuine provenance, fingerprint, exact-pin, or canonical-path gaps.
3. Continue governed discovery/source-vetting and omission recovery.
4. Resolve bounded candidate issues when evidence supports a decisive outcome.
5. Keep README, this file, `CURATION_QUEUE.md`, `INDEX.md`, and `index.json` aligned with live evidence.

The living work surface is `CURATION_QUEUE.md` plus applicable open evaluation/provenance issues. Historical closed Wayfinder/issues/PRs remain evidence, not active execution plans.
