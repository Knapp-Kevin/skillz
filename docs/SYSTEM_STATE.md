## Current architecture

The canonical boundary is stable: user-facing material lives under `skills/`; intact pinned upstream corpora live under `skills/sources/<source-id>/`; passive repository-use/curation procedures live under `engine/skills/` and are excluded from user-facing counts; provenance and exact-version evidence live under `registry/`.

`skillz` owns no runtime, scripts layer, tests gate, CI workflow, scheduler, monitor, crawler, installer, synchronizer, preflight process, generator, background service, vector database, autonomous observer, or personalization service. Tooling inside pinned third-party repositories remains upstream package material.

Normal DIRECT_LIBRARY, FIRST_VISIT, and RETURNING_USER work treats this repository as read-only reference material. User-derived skills target the user's active host/environment or a portable handoff. Only explicit REPOSITORY_MAINTENANCE authority permits repository mutation.

Microsoft direct-package accounting remains `.NET` **29/29**, Java **26/26**, Python **40/40**, Rust **9/9**, and TypeScript **25/25**.

Completion means decisive current evidence for every eligible package in the explicitly complete families above, not universal approval. Selectively tracked corpora may intentionally have only bounded individually governed units. Rejected and retired material remains useful bounded prior art.

## Jwynia Agent Skills — selective tracked corpus

Registered snapshot: `e02ec7e226a6e4f8419fd3b88a1d8e472d421b32`. Source scope: 112 skills, including 57 creative/narrative skills. Source-wide license state is **MIXED/per-skill** because no root `LICENSE` was found at the evaluated revision; individual declarations control.

Eight units are now individually governed: `story-collaborator` plus the bounded fiction tranche `story-sense`, `story-zoom`, `worldbuilding`, `character-arc`, `dialogue`, `scene-sequencing`, and `prose-style`. Six tranche units are **VERIFIED**: `story-sense`, `worldbuilding`, `character-arc`, `dialogue`, `scene-sequencing`, and `prose-style`. `story-zoom` is **REJECTED unchanged** because its useful cross-level synchronization model is coupled to persistent `story-state/` mutation and instructions to start a background watcher daemon without an action-appropriate authorization gate for that persistent process. Behavioral validation remains `not-run` for all eight governed units.

The source remains tracked for selective individual curation rather than vendored or blanket trusted. Source-owned scripts remain upstream package evidence and do not become repository-owned runtime. Exact fingerprints, dependencies, tags, authority findings, and rationale live in the canonical Jwynia provenance and verification companions.

## Corey Haines Marketing Skills — current-standard complete

Registered snapshot: `5b2c0007766c6a1cf1d53fd8fc73e979e0821022`. Root license: MIT. Exact eligible denominator: **50** top-level first-class `skills/<name>/SKILL.md` packages. Partner/integration guides, source-owned tooling, generated partner surfaces, and ordinary reference Markdown are outside the denominator.

All fifty packages now have current-standard provenance and exact-version verification companions. The final macro tranche adds `revops` **13/20 REJECTED unchanged**, `sales-enablement` **17/20 VERIFIED**, `schema` **17/20 VERIFIED**, `seo-audit` **17/20 VERIFIED**, `signup` **15/20 REJECTED unchanged**, `site-architecture` **17/20 VERIFIED**, `sms` **13/20 REJECTED unchanged**, `social` **14/20 REJECTED unchanged**, and `video` **13/20 REJECTED unchanged**. `VERIFIED` means exact-version structured static semantic review, not behavioral validation or automatic unchanged-use eligibility. Behavioral validation remains `not-run`.

**Macro synthesis:** Corey Haines is materially stronger as planning/checklist/design prior art than as unchanged operational authority, but the family contains meaningful bounded unchanged-use candidates. Recurring defects cluster around fragmented action authorization, privacy/minimization/consent/retention, unsupported or volatile quantitative marketing/platform claims, and incomplete safeguards around persuasive or external-action workflows. `seo-audit` is notable for an explicit untrusted-content boundary; `site-architecture` remains generate-only. `revops`, `sms`, `social`, and `video` cross into consequential external-action surfaces and require stronger authority boundaries; `signup` needs stronger identity/tracking/data-inference boundaries.

Exact fingerprints, package boundaries, dependencies, controlled tags, freshness evidence, authority findings, scores, and detailed rationale live in the canonical companions under `registry/skills/corey-haines-marketing-skills/` and `registry/verification/corey-haines-marketing-skills/`.

## Provenance and quality state

The corpus-wide provenance-completeness audit #66 is **closed completed**. First-party is **44/44 provenance-complete**, and every explicitly current-standard-complete third-party family in public accounting has zero package gaps. Selective tracked corpora remain bounded by the individual units actually admitted; they are not counted as whole-family complete. Every governed third-party unit must continue to retain truthful provenance and exact-version verification evidence; unknown facts remain unknown rather than inferred.

Static verification is not behavioral validation. `verified` means the exact bound material passed structured semantic review. `validated` requires representative external behavioral/adversarial evidence that actually exists. `rejected` and `retired` remain prior art but are excluded from normal unchanged selection.

The authority hard fail remains controlling: procedures that can mutate or materially affect infrastructure, external state, production traffic, money-bearing resources, credentials, subscriptions, DNS/routing, security controls, user communications, notifications, identity/access, persistent cloud resources, destructive lifecycle state, or sensitive-data disclosure require a real authorization boundary appropriate to the action.

The bounded controlled-taxonomy conformance audit #342 is **closed completed**. Ongoing conformance is ordinary curation hygiene against `registry/taxonomy.yaml`; historical examples and audit comments remain evidence only and do not establish current defects without live verification.

## Discovery and source vetting

Discovery runs in parallel with admitted-source maintenance but never grants quality, trust, installation authority, redistribution rights, or automatic admission. New third-party discoveries use the issue-first lifecycle in `docs/candidate-intake.md`.

Current governed discovery surfaces include the Creator Technical Resource Catalog, Hugging Face Skills, GitHub Awesome Copilot, Agent Skills Specification, canonical creator/source repositories, and candidate work recorded in the living curation ledger. Restricted or unclear-license material remains reference-only unless terms justify another role.

`jwynia/agent-skills` was admitted through issue #382 as a tracked corpus for selective individual curation. The source's missing root license prevents blanket license inference; per-skill declarations remain controlling.

`ConsultingFuture4200/unusual-thoughts` (#307) and `ConsultingFuture4200/repo-readme` (#308) are closed REFERENCE-ONLY candidates because canonical redistribution terms sufficient for governed corpus inclusion were not established.

## Current authority and lifecycle surfaces

- Wayfinder #35 remains canonical destination/scope evidence. Its stale frontier text is historical.
- Source queue #27, structure ticket #41, and PR #42 are closed historical evidence, not live execution authority.
- Provenance audit #66 and taxonomy-conformance audit #342 are closed completed; ongoing provenance and taxonomy conformance are ordinary curation hygiene.
- Current README, AGENTS, Governance Index, this file, CURATION_QUEUE, INDEX, index.json, source registry, and taxonomy control live repository truth.
- Open PRs and issues must be triaged before new curation. Ready authorized work should move through merge/closure rather than becoming permanent lifecycle furniture.

## Accounting contract

After every material corpus tranche, reconcile these five public surfaces atomically: `README.md`, `docs/SYSTEM_STATE.md`, `CURATION_QUEUE.md`, `INDEX.md`, and `index.json`. Recompute counts from live evidence. Do not increment stale counters. Do not merge a material tranche while these surfaces disagree.

## Next action

With the bounded Jwynia fiction tranche governed, continue the next coherent differentiated narrative tranche only through issue-first exact-version evaluation while maintaining ordinary governed source freshness, omission detection, and lifecycle hygiene. Do not bulk-promote the source.
