## Current architecture

The canonical boundary is stable: user-facing material lives under `skills/`; intact pinned upstream corpora live under `skills/sources/<source-id>/`; passive repository-use/curation procedures live under `engine/skills/` and are excluded from user-facing counts; provenance and exact-version evidence live under `registry/`.

`skillz` owns no runtime, scripts layer, tests gate, CI workflow, scheduler, monitor, crawler, installer, synchronizer, preflight process, generator, background service, vector database, autonomous observer, or personalization service. Tooling inside pinned third-party repositories remains upstream package material.

## Inventory boundaries

- First-party: **43/43 provenance-complete** with structured semantic review evidence.
- AWS Agent Toolkit: exact denominator **72**, **72/72 current-standard companion-complete** at pin `ff1481a7bc1a04ee00ebf63d3a8a149aa6a2c546`.
- Microsoft Skills: exact denominator **189**, **177/189 companion-complete**, **12 gaps** at pin `32cad4ee689c95c309e61aeefcbc6af356f1e6a7`.
- Microsoft direct `.NET`: **29/29** complete.
- Microsoft direct Java: **26/26** complete.
- Microsoft direct Python: **40/40** complete.
- Microsoft direct Rust: **9/9** complete.
- Microsoft direct TypeScript: **25/25** complete.

Completion means decisive current evidence for every eligible package, not universal approval. Rejected/retired material remains useful bounded prior art.

On 2026-09-05, the Microsoft frontier was reconciled against the current companion contract. Ten exact reviews from `kql` through `wiki-architect` that existed only as auxiliary Markdown evidence now also have mandatory YAML pairs under `registry/skills/` and `registry/verification/`. `skill-creator` already had a canonical YAML pair, so its later Markdown re-review did not add a new companion; that YAML pair was refreshed to the current 15/20 rejected authority disposition. Public accounting after the subsequent `wiki-vitepress` review resolves to **349 third-party exact-version companions / Microsoft Skills 177/189 / 12 gaps**.

## Active Microsoft frontier

The direct TypeScript slice is **25/25 current-standard companion-complete**. The non-direct Microsoft plugin/front-door frontier is active. Latest closure: `wiki-vitepress` is **rejected unchanged, 14/20**, bound to package tree `fb40a7721e7038dde865905b9626602b7a2da77d` and `SKILL.md` blob `b29a15e05917cb599592604643827c4fc7b6190e`, with freshness revision `67ae723a23ba880e3e5e8a3e5e2320092024476e` from 2026-04-02. Preserve deterministic VitePress scaffolding, layered dark-mode Mermaid handling, SSR-aware Vue lifecycle guidance, click-to-zoom behavior, Markdown compatibility post-processing, and explicit build-output expectations. Unchanged adoption fails the authority hard rule because the procedure directs persistent `wiki-site/` and `package.json` creation, `npm install`, and a production build without a mandatory action-specific authorization checkpoint. Behavioral validation is `not-run`.

Microsoft Skills remains active with **12** gaps. Establish the next gap from the exact registered-pin source tree after `wiki-vitepress`, checking canonical registry companions and repository history before review.

## Source lifecycle

**discovery surface → candidate issue/source → source-vetting → exact-version static evaluation → decisive admission result → repository persistence when justified → user-fit decision**

Discovery is intelligence only. Popularity, branding, creator reputation, and source-level signals never prove individual skill quality.

## Quality model

Every governed user-facing skill must retain truthful provenance and applicable exact-version evidence before being called companion-complete. `verified` means exact material passed structured static semantic review. `validated` additionally requires representative external behavioral/adversarial evidence. `stale`, `rejected`, and `retired` are excluded from normal unchanged reuse while remaining useful evidence where appropriate.

Interpret candidate material in this order:

**user fit → exact-version quality → operational fit → skill freshness → provenance/source context**

## Current curation priority

1. Continue Microsoft Skills in registered-pin source order from the first genuine gap after `wiki-vitepress`.
2. Complete remaining Microsoft Skills non-direct families.
3. Complete Microsoft Azure Skills.
4. Reconcile historically completed external corpora from compatible prior evidence before fresh re-review.
5. Continue governed discovery/source-vetting and omission recovery.
6. Keep README, this file, `CURATION_QUEUE.md`, `INDEX.md`, and `index.json` aligned with live evidence.

The living work surface is `CURATION_QUEUE.md` plus applicable open evaluation/provenance issues. Historical closed Wayfinder/issues/PRs remain evidence, not active execution plans.
