## Current architecture

The canonical boundary is stable: user-facing material lives under `skills/`; intact pinned upstream corpora live under `skills/sources/<source-id>/`; passive repository-use/curation procedures live under `engine/skills/` and are excluded from user-facing counts; provenance and exact-version evidence live under `registry/`.

`skillz` owns no runtime, scripts layer, tests gate, CI workflow, scheduler, monitor, crawler, installer, synchronizer, preflight process, generator, background service, vector database, autonomous observer, or personalization service. Tooling inside pinned third-party repositories remains upstream package material.

## Inventory boundaries

- First-party: **43/43 provenance-complete** with structured semantic review evidence.
- AWS Agent Toolkit: exact denominator **72**, **72/72 current-standard companion-complete** at pin `ff1481a7bc1a04ee00ebf63d3a8a149aa6a2c546`.
- Microsoft Skills: exact denominator **186**, **186/186 companion-complete**, **0 gaps** at pin `32cad4ee689c95c309e61aeefcbc6af356f1e6a7`.
- Microsoft direct `.NET`: **29/29** complete.
- Microsoft direct Java: **26/26** complete.
- Microsoft direct Python: **40/40** complete.
- Microsoft direct Rust: **9/9** complete.
- Microsoft direct TypeScript: **25/25** complete.

Completion means decisive current evidence for every eligible package, not universal approval. Rejected/retired material remains useful bounded prior art.

On 2026-09-05, the Microsoft frontier was reconciled against the current companion contract. Ten exact reviews from `kql` through `wiki-architect` that existed only as auxiliary Markdown evidence now also have mandatory YAML pairs under `registry/skills/` and `registry/verification/`. `skill-creator` already had a canonical YAML pair, so its later Markdown re-review did not add a new companion; that YAML pair was refreshed to the current 15/20 rejected authority disposition.

## Microsoft Skills closure

The direct language slices, `deep-wiki`, `microsoft-365-agents-toolkit`, and the independently front-mattered Microsoft Foundry packages are companion-complete. Exact-pin reconciliation confirms the `microsoft-foundry` plugin exposes ten dangling symlinks rather than independent skill packages; canonical Foundry material lives under `.github/plugins/azure-skills/skills/microsoft-foundry`.

A final denominator pass corrected the prior **189** figure to **186**. The canonical `models/deploy-model` tree contains exactly four independently front-mattered `SKILL.md` entry points: root, `capacity`, `customize`, and `preset`, all already companioned. Other Foundry workflow documents such as `project/create/create-foundry-project.md`, `resource/create/create-foundry-resource.md`, and `resource/private-network/private-network.md` are ordinary Markdown referenced by the root skill, not independent front-mattered skills. Ordinary references and duplicate/dangling exposure paths do not enter the eligible denominator.

Microsoft Skills therefore closes at **186/186** with **0** current-standard gaps and **358** persisted third-party exact-version companions overall. No synthetic companion records were added to reconcile the stale counter.

## Source lifecycle

**discovery surface → candidate issue/source → source-vetting → exact-version static evaluation → decisive admission result → repository persistence when justified → user-fit decision**

Discovery is intelligence only. Popularity, branding, creator reputation, and source-level signals never prove individual skill quality.

## Quality model

Every governed user-facing skill must retain truthful provenance and applicable exact-version evidence before being called companion-complete. `verified` means exact material passed structured static semantic review. `validated` additionally requires representative external behavioral/adversarial evidence. `stale`, `rejected`, and `retired` are excluded from normal unchanged reuse while remaining useful evidence where appropriate.

Interpret candidate material in this order:

**user fit → exact-version quality → operational fit → skill freshness → provenance/source context**

## Current curation priority

1. Establish the exact registered-pin denominator for Microsoft Azure Skills and reconcile the first genuine current-standard gap.
2. Reconcile historically completed external corpora from compatible prior evidence before fresh re-review.
3. Continue governed discovery/source-vetting and omission recovery.
4. Resolve bounded candidate issues when evidence supports a decisive outcome.
5. Keep README, this file, `CURATION_QUEUE.md`, `INDEX.md`, and `index.json` aligned with live evidence.

The living work surface is `CURATION_QUEUE.md` plus applicable open evaluation/provenance issues. Historical closed Wayfinder/issues/PRs remain evidence, not active execution plans.
