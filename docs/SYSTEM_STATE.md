## Current architecture

The canonical boundary is stable: user-facing material lives under `skills/`; intact pinned upstream corpora live under `skills/sources/<source-id>/`; passive repository-use/curation procedures live under `engine/skills/` and are excluded from user-facing counts; provenance and exact-version evidence live under `registry/`.

`skillz` owns no runtime, scripts layer, tests gate, CI workflow, scheduler, monitor, crawler, installer, synchronizer, preflight process, generator, background service, vector database, autonomous observer, or personalization service. Tooling inside pinned third-party repositories remains upstream package material.

## Inventory boundaries

- First-party: **43/43 provenance-complete** with structured semantic review evidence.
- AWS Agent Toolkit: **72/72** current-standard companion-complete.
- Microsoft Skills: **186/186** companion-complete, **0 gaps**.
- Microsoft Azure Skills: exact registered-pin denominator **131**, **31/131** companion-complete, **100 gaps** at pin `8f8c72bb9e22aee4366e07aadfd5766ef9add8f4`.
- Microsoft direct `.NET`: **29/29**; Java: **26/26**; Python: **40/40**; Rust: **9/9**; TypeScript: **25/25**.

Completion means decisive current evidence for every eligible package, not universal approval. Rejected/retired material remains useful bounded prior art.

## Microsoft Azure Skills frontier

Thirty-one Azure packages now have current-standard companion pairs. Behavioral validation remains `not-run` for all thirty-one.

The latest unit, nested `microsoft-foundry/models/deploy-model/capacity`, is verified **17/20** and is bound to exact tree `edb0b5bb776569c8941e4ed3755d9f65e32c5b80`, `SKILL.md` blob `46935315ebdf18fbc93771efb72e7f8f9e9980ac`, and Azure-path freshness revision `d98f6dd642338a5f5a423f4c17ab65dc1208d88d` on 2026-03-04. Exact identity matches completed Microsoft Skills evidence, so compatible structured static review evidence was reused. Preserve read-only Azure OpenAI capacity and subscription-quota discovery, ranked region/project comparison, explicit no-deploy scope, and project confirmation before handoff to `preset` or `customize`. The bundled scripts query Azure management and usage APIs but do not create, update, or delete resources. Nested `customize` and `preset` remain independently eligible denominator entries. Behavioral validation remains `not-run`.

## Source lifecycle

**discovery surface → candidate issue/source → source-vetting → exact-version static evaluation → decisive admission result → repository persistence when justified → user-fit decision**

Discovery is intelligence only. Popularity, branding, creator reputation, and source-level signals never prove individual skill quality.

## Quality model

Every governed user-facing skill must retain truthful provenance and applicable exact-version evidence before being called companion-complete. `verified` means exact material passed structured static semantic review. `validated` additionally requires representative external behavioral/adversarial evidence. `stale`, `rejected`, and `retired` are excluded from normal unchanged reuse while remaining useful evidence where appropriate.

Interpret candidate material in this order:

**user fit → exact-version quality → operational fit → skill freshness → provenance/source context**

## Current curation priority

1. Continue Microsoft Azure Skills from **31/131**, checking canonical companion paths and repository history before each unit.
2. Reconcile historically completed external corpora from compatible prior evidence before fresh re-review.
3. Continue governed discovery/source-vetting and omission recovery.
4. Resolve bounded candidate issues when evidence supports a decisive outcome.
5. Keep README, this file, `CURATION_QUEUE.md`, `INDEX.md`, and `index.json` aligned with live evidence.

The living work surface is `CURATION_QUEUE.md` plus applicable open evaluation/provenance issues. Historical closed Wayfinder/issues/PRs remain evidence, not active execution plans.
