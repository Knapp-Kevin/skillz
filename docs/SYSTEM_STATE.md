## Current architecture

The canonical boundary is stable: user-facing material lives under `skills/`; intact pinned upstream corpora live under `skills/sources/<source-id>/`; passive repository-use/curation procedures live under `engine/skills/` and are excluded from user-facing counts; provenance and exact-version evidence live under `registry/`.

`skillz` owns no runtime, scripts layer, tests gate, CI workflow, scheduler, monitor, crawler, installer, synchronizer, preflight process, generator, background service, vector database, autonomous observer, or personalization service. Tooling inside pinned third-party repositories remains upstream package material.

## Inventory boundaries

- First-party: **43/43 provenance-complete** with structured semantic review evidence.
- AWS Agent Toolkit: exact denominator **72**, **72/72 current-standard companion-complete** at pin `ff1481a7bc1a04ee00ebf63d3a8a149aa6a2c546`.
- Microsoft Skills: exact denominator **189**, **81/189 companion-complete**, **108 gaps** at pin `32cad4ee689c95c309e61aeefcbc6af356f1e6a7`.
- Microsoft direct `.NET`: **29/29** complete.
- Microsoft direct Java: **26/26** complete.
- Microsoft direct Python: **22/40** complete.

Completion means decisive current evidence for every eligible package, not universal approval. Rejected/retired material remains useful bounded prior art.

## Active Microsoft frontier

Python is active and now runs source-order through `azure-messaging-webpubsubservice-py`.

Latest tranche, with `validation_status: not-run`:

- `azure-messaging-webpubsubservice-py` — **rejected unchanged, 8/20**. Exact one-file review covers Entra-first authentication, access-token generation, broadcasts and targeted messaging, groups, connections, and permission APIs. Useful patterns remain prior art, but unchanged examples print credential-bearing client access URLs, send external messages, mutate membership, terminate connections, and grant/revoke permissions without explicit token-disclosure, audience/content, membership, disconnect, or action-authorization boundaries. Metered use and unpinned installation also remain unbounded.

The next source-ordered package is `azure-mgmt-apicenter-py`.

## Source lifecycle

**discovery surface → candidate issue/source → source-vetting → exact-version static evaluation → decisive admission result → repository persistence when justified → user-fit decision**

Discovery is intelligence only. Popularity, branding, creator reputation, and source-level signals never prove individual skill quality.

## Quality model

Every governed user-facing skill must retain truthful provenance and applicable exact-version evidence before being called companion-complete. `verified` means exact material passed structured static semantic review. `validated` additionally requires representative external behavioral/adversarial evidence. `stale`, `rejected`, and `retired` are excluded from normal unchanged reuse while remaining useful evidence where appropriate.

Interpret candidate material in this order:

**user fit → exact-version quality → operational fit → skill freshness → provenance/source context**

## Current curation priority

1. Continue Microsoft Skills in coherent source-ordered batches, with Python at **22/40**.
2. Complete Microsoft Azure Skills.
3. Reconcile historically completed external corpora from compatible prior evidence before fresh re-review.
4. Continue governed discovery/source-vetting and omission recovery.
5. Keep README, this file, `CURATION_QUEUE.md`, `INDEX.md`, and `index.json` aligned with live evidence.

The living work surface is `CURATION_QUEUE.md` plus applicable open evaluation/provenance issues. Historical closed Wayfinder/issues/PRs remain evidence, not active execution plans.
