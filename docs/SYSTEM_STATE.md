## Current architecture

The canonical boundary is stable: user-facing material lives under `skills/`; intact pinned upstream corpora live under `skills/sources/<source-id>/`; passive repository-use/curation procedures live under `engine/skills/` and are excluded from user-facing counts; provenance and exact-version evidence live under `registry/`.

`skillz` owns no runtime, scripts layer, tests gate, CI workflow, scheduler, monitor, crawler, installer, synchronizer, preflight process, generator, background service, vector database, autonomous observer, or personalization service. Tooling inside pinned third-party repositories remains upstream package material.

## Inventory boundaries

- First-party: **43/43 provenance-complete** with structured semantic review evidence.
- AWS Agent Toolkit: exact denominator **72**, **72/72 current-standard companion-complete** at pin `ff1481a7bc1a04ee00ebf63d3a8a149aa6a2c546`.
- Microsoft Skills: exact denominator **189**, **138/189 companion-complete**, **51 gaps** at pin `32cad4ee689c95c309e61aeefcbc6af356f1e6a7`.
- Microsoft direct `.NET`: **29/29** complete.
- Microsoft direct Java: **26/26** complete.
- Microsoft direct Python: **40/40** complete.
- Microsoft direct Rust: **9/9** complete.
- Microsoft direct TypeScript: **25/25** complete.

Completion means decisive current evidence for every eligible package, not universal approval. Rejected/retired material remains useful bounded prior art.

## Active Microsoft frontier

The direct TypeScript slice is **25/25 current-standard companion-complete**. Twenty-two packages are rejected unchanged and three bounded local implementation packages are verified: `frontend-ui-dark-ts` **15/20**, `react-flow-node-ts` **15/20**, and `zustand-store-ts` **16/20**. Exact identities, freshness, authority, portability, dependencies, rationale, and validation state remain in their individual companion records.

The non-direct Microsoft plugin frontier is active. Reviewed packages now include:

1. `airunway-aks-setup` — **rejected unchanged, 15/20**.
2. `appinsights-instrumentation` — **rejected unchanged, 12/20**.
3. `azure-ai` — **rejected unchanged, 10/20**.
4. `azure-aigateway` — **rejected unchanged, 8/20**.
5. `azure-cloud-migrate` — **rejected unchanged, 9/20**.
6. `azure-compliance` — **rejected unchanged, 12/20**, package tree `5d79eadfd4a42ff0091adb849bf016abd7ee57de`, `SKILL.md` blob `5beb9da33c90ceff1b69ff78bdba78c326fd7a39`, freshness revision `951d18d43210f0d93a931ae5d5c2a774f63d5faf` from 2026-04-21. It preserves read-only compliance scanning, azqr, Resource Graph, Key Vault expiration review, evidence capture, prioritization, and recommendation mechanics, and explicitly separates compliance reporting from remediation execution. Unchanged adoption fails because bundled remediation patterns directly create or alter private endpoints, network access, retention, Key Vault RBAC mode, diagnostics, backup, AKS security/identity, SQL auditing/private access, App Service identity, HTTPS/TLS, and bulk resource configuration without mandatory target-resource, identity/access, security-control, network-exposure, production, cost, retention/recovery, or per-action authorization. Behavioral validation is `not-run`.

Microsoft Skills remains active with **51** gaps. Establish the next gap from the registered-pin tree after `azure-compliance`; do not infer it from stale prompts or historical issue text.

## Source lifecycle

**discovery surface → candidate issue/source → source-vetting → exact-version static evaluation → decisive admission result → repository persistence when justified → user-fit decision**

Discovery is intelligence only. Popularity, branding, creator reputation, and source-level signals never prove individual skill quality.

## Quality model

Every governed user-facing skill must retain truthful provenance and applicable exact-version evidence before being called companion-complete. `verified` means exact material passed structured static semantic review. `validated` additionally requires representative external behavioral/adversarial evidence. `stale`, `rejected`, and `retired` are excluded from normal unchanged reuse while remaining useful evidence where appropriate.

Interpret candidate material in this order:

**user fit → exact-version quality → operational fit → skill freshness → provenance/source context**

## Current curation priority

1. Continue Microsoft Skills in registered-pin source order from the first genuine gap after `azure-compliance`.
2. Complete remaining Microsoft Skills non-direct plugin families.
3. Complete Microsoft Azure Skills.
4. Reconcile historically completed external corpora from compatible prior evidence before fresh re-review.
5. Continue governed discovery/source-vetting and omission recovery.
6. Keep README, this file, `CURATION_QUEUE.md`, `INDEX.md`, and `index.json` aligned with live evidence.

The living work surface is `CURATION_QUEUE.md` plus applicable open evaluation/provenance issues. Historical closed Wayfinder/issues/PRs remain evidence, not active execution plans.
