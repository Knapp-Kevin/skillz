## Current architecture

The canonical boundary is stable: user-facing material lives under `skills/`; intact pinned upstream corpora live under `skills/sources/<source-id>/`; passive repository-use/curation procedures live under `engine/skills/` and are excluded from user-facing counts; provenance and exact-version evidence live under `registry/`.

`skillz` owns no runtime, scripts layer, tests gate, CI workflow, scheduler, monitor, crawler, installer, synchronizer, preflight process, generator, background service, vector database, autonomous observer, or personalization service. Tooling inside pinned third-party repositories remains upstream package material.

## Inventory boundaries

- First-party: **43/43 provenance-complete** with structured semantic review evidence.
- AWS Agent Toolkit: **72/72** current-standard companion-complete.
- Microsoft Skills: **186/186** companion-complete, **0 gaps**.
- Microsoft Azure Skills: exact registered-pin denominator **34**, **34/34** companion-complete, **0 gaps** at pin `8f8c72bb9e22aee4366e07aadfd5766ef9add8f4`.
- Cole Medin Skills: exact registered-pin denominator **33**, **28/33** companion-complete, **5 gaps** at pin `fb2e876f057c5356d6603ba0c52d6b4418d893ba`.
- Microsoft direct `.NET`: **29/29**; Java: **26/26**; Python: **40/40**; Rust: **9/9**; TypeScript: **25/25**.

Completion means decisive current evidence for every eligible package, not universal approval. Rejected/retired material remains useful bounded prior art.

## Microsoft Azure Skills denominator reconciliation

The exact pin exposes 28 canonical plugin skill roots, one additional nested Kubernetes automatic-readiness package, and five additional nested first-class Microsoft Foundry packages beyond the Foundry root. That yields an eligible denominator of **34**, exactly matching the current companion pairs. Ordinary workflow, procedure, reference, example, SDK, or other Markdown is not independently first-class skill content. The latest Azure package-level reconciliation remains `python-appservice-deploy`, rejected unchanged **12/20**, behavioral validation `not-run`.

## Cole Medin Skills frontier

The registered pin contains **33** first-class `.claude/skills/*/SKILL.md` entries. Twenty-eight now have current companion pairs: `ablate-ai-layer`, `rules-check-drift`, `second-brain-audit`, `agent-browser`, `ast-grep`, `build-dark-factory`, `hooks-create`, `opportunity-scan`, `piv-commit`, `piv-create-pr`, `piv-fix-review-findings`, `piv-implement-issue`, `piv-implement`, `piv-investigate-issue`, `piv-plan-implementation`, `piv-review-changes`, `piv-review-pr`, `piv-run-full-loop`, `piv-slice-epic`, `piv-validate`, `plan-architecture`, `plan-create-prd`, `plan-create-stories`, `prime-backend`, `prime-codebase`, `prime-frontend`, `rules-create-global`, and `setup-ai-tutor`.

`setup-ai-tutor` is bound to exact package tree `05b6a7bc0dd59857ae773fe8fce48647ea48ff08`, `SKILL.md` blob `a44163b06a02c740a7ddf569d679266ac1bbf27a`, and skill-path freshness revision `356511604c75008271ec34933864ccba09100202` on 2026-08-04. It is rejected unchanged **12/20** with behavioral validation `not-run`. Preserve its staged setup ordering, explicit API/database health checks, cleanup guidance, and project-specific value verification note. Unchanged use remains rejected because dependency installation, persistent database startup, schema migration, and server startup occur without mandatory action-specific authorization immediately before consequential actions. It also creates a live `.env` from repository-controlled material without an explicit hostile-instruction or secret-handling boundary, and health-check output lacks mandatory sensitive-data minimization.

## Source lifecycle

**discovery surface → candidate issue/source → source-vetting → exact-version static evaluation → decisive admission result → repository persistence when justified → user-fit decision**

Discovery is intelligence only. Popularity, branding, creator reputation, and source-level signals never prove individual skill quality.

## Quality model

Every governed user-facing skill must retain truthful provenance and applicable exact-version evidence before being called companion-complete. `verified` means exact material passed structured static semantic review. `validated` additionally requires representative external behavioral/adversarial evidence. `stale`, `rejected`, and `retired` are excluded from normal unchanged reuse while remaining useful evidence where appropriate.

Interpret candidate material in this order:

**user fit → exact-version quality → operational fit → skill freshness → provenance/source context**

## Current curation priority

1. Continue Cole Medin Skills exact-version curation from the registered 33-skill denominator, checking existing companions and prior evidence before every unit.
2. Reconcile historically completed external corpora from compatible prior evidence before fresh re-review.
3. Continue governed discovery/source-vetting and omission recovery.
4. Resolve bounded candidate issues when evidence supports a decisive outcome.
5. Keep README, this file, `CURATION_QUEUE.md`, `INDEX.md`, and `index.json` aligned with live evidence.

The living work surface is `CURATION_QUEUE.md` plus applicable open evaluation/provenance issues. Historical closed Wayfinder/issues/PRs remain evidence, not active execution plans.
